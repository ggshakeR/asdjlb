Welcome to the ggshakeR library! 

ggshakeR is Râ€™s all-inclusive package for visualization and analysis of publicly available soccer data. The package aims to provide people interested in football analysis and visualization a platform to learn about it while also learning a new language at the same time. All using freely available data!

So, what is ggshakeR library then? 

This is our attempt at going a step beyond the functions within the package. This website serves as a place where we hope to produce articles and content pertaining to working with football data in R.

We're extremely glad to have you on this journey with us. We hope you enjoy using this as much as we enjoyed making it!
