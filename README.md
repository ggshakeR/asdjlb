## How to Contribute

We welcome and encourage contributions to the ggshakeR library and gallery as we view this as a community based and led project. Given below are some guidelines and instructions for contributing. 

We encourage you to reach out the team on Twitter with the ideas you have for contributing.

### Gallery

The gallery is the section of the website where code for specific football/soccer based visualizations are stored. Here is how to contribute:-

1. Install Git.
2. Fork this repository. 
3. Clone the repo onto your local system. 
4. Add your complete code (from loading libraries to saving the plot) to the `Gallery Code` folder in the repository. Make sure that your code is heavily commented, feel free to check out the scripts that are already present in the repository to get familiar with the preffered format for the script.    
5. Go to the `gallery.md` file and add in an image of the plot you have added the code for, along with a small description (The data source). Make sure to add your name as the author below the image.
6. When you're done with these steps, go ahead and git push your changes to the main repo.
