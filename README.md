## How to Contribute

We welcome and encourage contributions to the ggshakeR library and gallery as we view this as a community based and led project. Given below are some guidelines and instructions for contributing. 

We encourage you to reach out the team on Twitter with the ideas you have for contributing.

### Gallery

The gallery is the section of the website where code for specific football/soccer based visualizations are stored. Here is how to contribute:-

1. Install Git.
2. Fork this repository. 
3. Clone the repo onto your local system. 
4. Open a new branch.
5. Add your complete code (from loading libraries to saving the plot) to the `plots` folder within the `gallery` folder in the repository. Make sure that your code is heavily commented, feel free to check out the scripts that are already present in the repository to get familiar with the preferred format for the script.    
6. Go to the `plots.md` file within the `pages` folder in `gallery` and add in an image of the plot you have added the code for, along with a small description (The data source). Make sure to add your name as the author below the image.
7. When you're done with these steps, go ahead and git push your changes to the main repo.
8. Log onto your GitHub account and click on the **"Compare and Pull Request"** button for your forked repository. 

And you're done! Your changed will be approved and merged with the main website.

### Library

Here is how you can contribute by writing an article :-

1. Install Git.
2. Fork this repository. 
3. Clone the repo onto your local system. 
4. Open a new branch.
5. Check and copy all the correct format (title as well as main article) for the markdown document and add your completed *.md* file to the `_posts` folder. Make sure to add your name as the author at the end of the article. 
6. Add your thumbnail/title image and other images to the `img` folder under `assets`. Do the same if you have any GIF's. Make sure to specify the correct path and name to the image in the article. 
7. If there is a lot of code in your article, It would be a good addition to add your complete code to the `_posts code` folder.
8. When you're done with these steps, go ahead and git push your changes to the main repo.
